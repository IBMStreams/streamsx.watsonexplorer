## Introduction

IBM Watson Explorer is a platform for development of enterprise information navigation and search applications. It provides users with a 360-degree view of their information while also being able to gain deeper insight via advanced text analysis.

By combining IBM Streams with Watson Explorer, users can easily correlate real-time data with historical documents indexed by Watson Explorer in order to provide context and meaning to their data. For example, combining IBM Streams with Watson Explorer can be useful in a call centre scenario. Customers may call in with specific problems or concerns related to their services. IBM Streams can perform real-time speech-to-text recognition of the conversation. Keywords extracted from the conversation between the customer and the call centre agent can be used to quickly generate a search query and retrieve relevant knowledge base articles and scripts from a Watson Explorer collection. By recommending relevant documents in real-time and in context, IBM Streams allows the agents to more efficiently address the customerâ€™s specific concerns, resulting in faster resolution of the problem and higher customer satisfaction.

[IBM Watson Explorer](https://www.ibm.com/us-en/marketplace/content-analytics) is comprised of two sets of components: foundational components and analytics component.


### Foundation Components

The foundational components provide federated discovery, navigation, and search over a broad range of data sources and types. The software includes a framework for developing information-rich applications that deliver a comprehensive, contextually-relevant, 360-degree view of any topic for business users, data scientists, and a variety of targeted business functions.


### Analytical Components

The analytical components, which are provided in Watson Explorer Advanced Edition, help analysts transform information into insights through visualizations that reveal trends, patterns, anomalies, and relationships. The analytical components also enable custom and domain-specific text analytics, which can enhance 360-degree view and content mining applications.
